Quilt
=====

Quilt is an experimental HTML5 tile-shifting game. Something like a 2-D Rubik's cube.

It's built on top of my barebones HTML5 game library, [TangleJS](https://github.com/buyog/TangleJS),
and is my first entry in the [One Game a Month](http://www.onegameamonth.com) coding challenge.

I'm going to follow the (McFunkypants Method)[http://gamedev.tutsplus.com/articles/business-articles/1gam-how-to-succeed-at-making-one-game-a-month/] 
with this project:

* Determine the MVP (minimum viable product).
* Ship often: every time I "level up" the MVP with a new fully-playable version, I'll commit it to this Github repo.
